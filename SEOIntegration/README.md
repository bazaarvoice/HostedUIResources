# Bazaarvoice Cloud SEO SDK

Product reviews, questions, and answers can provide an immense amount of SEO
value for product detail pages. The language and keywords users use when writing
reviews, questions, or answers often match other users' search keywords, and can
help increase traffic to your product detail pages. In addition, search engines
like to see fresh content, and reviews, questions, and answers are a great way
of providing a steady stream of fresh content to often stagnant product
information pages.

For search engines to crawl and index Bazaarvoice captured content, the content
must be server-side included on the product detail pages. This is required
because not all major search engines yet index JavaScript-rendered content (what
your users see when they use a web browser to view your product pages). A good
test to see what search engines see when they crawl a product page is to open
your product page in a browser, right click and view the source for that page.
This will allow you to see the markup that search engines will index. You will
notice that JavaScript-rendered markup is not present (look for the
BVRRContainer or BVQAContainer specifically).

## Cloud SEO

Bazaarvoice's Cloud SEO allows you to server-side include Bazaarvoice captured
content so product detail pages get the maximum SEO value possible from user
submitted reviews, questions, or answers. When Cloud SEO is enabled, Bazaarvoice
will host URLs that will contain HTML "blobs" for all your products.  These HTML
blobs contain the review, questions, or answers content that users have
submitted through Bazaarvoice, wrapped in SEO optimized markup
([schema.org][1]).

## SEO SDKs

To make implementing Cloud SEO easier, Bazaarvoice provides an SDK / library for
the following languages:

* [Java][2]
* [.NET][3]
* [PHP][4]
* [Python][5]

If you are using a server-side language that is not listed above, you still can
use Cloud SEO by following the generic implementation steps listed at the bottom
of this page.

NOTE: Using Cloud SEO (SDKs included) requires that the requester's user agent
is exposed and accurate for each request. This typically is a problem only if
you are leveraging a CDN like Akamai. There are workarounds for this; for
example, you can configure your CDN to pass through the user agent string with
each request.

## Generic Cloud SEO

This section explains how Cloud SEO works in general. This will be helpful if
you need to use Cloud SEO with a language for which Bazaarvoice does not yet
provide an SDK, or for those who want to know the steps taken by the SDKs.
While each language's SDK may differ slightly in the details, they typically
follow the same workflow.

Here are the steps you must follow to implement Cloud SEO:

1. Determine if the current request is a search engine by checking the user
agent string. An example of how to do this would be to check a regular
expression against the user agent string. In the PHP SDK, for example:

    ```php
        preg_match('/(msnbot|googlebot|teoma|bingbot|yandexbot|yahoo')/i', $_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT']);
    ```

2. If the current request is coming from a search engine, we need to determine
which page of SEO content we need to request. This can be determined by the
bvrrp URL parameter. If this parameter doesn't exist we default to requesting
page 1. If it exists, then the page we need to request will be inside the value
of this parameter.

3.  Next, we make a request to the URL containing the SEO content we need. You
can use this pattern to build that URL:

    >http://seo-stg.bazaarvoice.com/{seo-key}/{deployment-zone}-{locale}/{content-type}/{subject-type}/{page-number}/{product-id}.htm

    For example, you were going to request page 1 of review content for the product1 product, the full URL would look like this:

    >http://seo.bazaarvoice.com/brim-44a1a9b0ea7a809ba45134f8b5570a03/Main_Site-en_US/reviews/product/1/50001.htm

    These URLs are pointing to staging. To request production data you would use
    `seo.bazaarvoice.com` instead of `seo-stg.bazaarvoice.com`.

4. Now that SEO content is retrieved, we need to replace all instances of the
string `{INSERT_URI_TOKEN}` with the current page's URL. This is to build in
pagination between the pages of content so search engines can crawl all the
pages of UGC content.

5. Now we are ready to render this formatted SEO string onto the page in the
correct container. For reviews this is inside `<div id="BVRRContainer"></div>`,
and for questions this is inside `<div id="BVQAContainer">\</div>`. To test SEO
integration, view the source of the page and verify that the SEO content is
inside the div.
